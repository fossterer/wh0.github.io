Earlier today, I was thinking, "I need to do this thing at 6 o'clock."
So I set my phone to remind me.
6:00 rolled around.
Nothing happened, because my phone was dozing.

At 6:11, the maintenance window started, and my phone reminded me.
"Dang it, now I'm short on time," I thought, "This is all Google's fault."

At 6:55, I thought to myself, "I should really get off of Reddit and start working."

And that's when I started writing this post instead.
