title: Windows+D
---
Sometimes you have a bunch of windows open.
And you want to launch something.
But you didn't check the box to create a start menu entry when you installed it.
But you did check the box to create an icon on the desktop.

When that happens, you press Windows+D to minimize everything, so that you can see your desktop.
Then, you can launch it.

Then comes the part that take some serious skill.
You gotta press Windows+D again to restore all your windows.
And you gotta do it really fast, before new program starts.
Because once it starts, pressing Windows+D will just minimize that new program.
And you're stuck restoring all your windows one by one.
Like a sucker.
