There's a lot of pointing and clicking to be done on the web.
That makes it a pain to shift over and use the right half of the keyboard.
I appreciate that they've loaded up the left half with lots of hotkeys.

Previously, it was possible to select a word with the mouse, press Ctrl+F to open the find bar, and press Alt+A to highlight all matches, without ever having to move your hands around.

New in Firefox 52, ["Highlight All" is now Alt+L](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435326).
This resolves a conflict for Control-A on Mac, which also meant "Move to the beginning of the line or paragraph."
I don't even use Mac, but now I have to look down whenever I want to highlight all matches.

Mac people, you did this to me.
