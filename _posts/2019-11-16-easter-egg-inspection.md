There's an inspection called "Code contains easter egg" that comes with Android Studio.
This one:

How can it systematically detect an easter egg?

It turns out that this inspection is limited to a narrow definition of an easter egg used in the inspection's description.
It finds a certain syntax of Java *code* that tries not to look like code, not features, like a flight simulator hidden in a spreadsheet program.

From [the implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/2f03004c181baf9d291a9bf992e1b444e83cd82d/lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/CommentDetector.java#177) of this lint,
we can see that it searches for the string `\u002a\u002f` inside a comment.
That's some kind of escaped form of `*/`.

[Supposedly](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.2) it's correct to unescape these sequences before even lexing comments.
But the syntax highlighting in Android Studio doesn't behave this way.

So indeed you might consider that code to be "hidden."

Wait, does this mean Unicode string escapes aren't actually parsed in the safe confines of a string literal?
