title: A new offer for my service providers
previous_teaser: 
previous_first: true

In the coming week, I'll be changing my usage of one or more services that I have used for many years.
I realize the changes can come across as blaming providers for providing their services.
For this, I am truly sorry and would like to apologize to the community.

For my loyal service providers, I am adding a new offer that lets you keep my usage the same when the changes happen next week.
From now until January 25, you can sign up to keep my usage the same at the link below.

I am genuinely sorry for the frustration this decision has caused and for the way it was communicated.
Thank you for sticking with me.
