Long story short, Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages are search results.
Really, really rich search results.

First let's look at the plainest kind of search result.
They have a title, a URL, and a description or a snippet of text.

![]({% include asset-path.txt name="result-plain.png" %})

These days there are also ["rich results"](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery), which show more information.
They'll still have the title and URL, but this one's got a picture of a dish that the page has a recipe for and an excerpt from the directions.

![]({% include asset-path.txt name="result-rich.png" %})

Now think richer.
Like, as rich as possible.

What if the result took up the entire page?
And could put *anything* on the result.
Images, videos, uh ... oh yeah, text ... hmm, maybe custom fonts too?
That's all that can possibly be on the web, right?
Oh and ads!
The results would be *so* rich people would run ads on it.

What would it look like?
Title, URL, and ✨all the things✨.

![]({% include asset-path.txt name="amp.png" %})

But by now it would take up the entire screen.
So you'd probably have to click into it.
But they're still just search results.

How would this be implemented?
We'd probably do it the same way we currently do rich search results.
With some kind of [special markup](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components) that Google's crawler could pick up.

As search results, these extra-rich results of data are completely static between scrapes of your site, and they're served from Google.
Incidentally, this means that they *are* pretty fast to load.

Or maybe they started with HTML and tried to dumb it down so that they could restrict the creativity of web authoring marginalize content creators.
