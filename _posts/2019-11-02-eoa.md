In the animation above,
the red square travels for 191 frames (on a 60 Hz display) between bounces off the left and right walls of the inner box, and
it travels for 111 frames between bounces off the top and bottom walls.
So it should hit a corner every 21,201 frames.

The inner box travels for 622 frames between bounces off the left and right walls of the outer box, and
it travels for 362 frames between bounces off the top and bottom walls.
So it should hit a corner every 112,528 frames.

Both should hit the corner simultaneously every 2,385,706,128 frames, or about 0.67 times the orbital period of Mars.

I made this back in 2016, so it would have happened already if one left it open all this time.
