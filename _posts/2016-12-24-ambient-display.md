Android has a feature called Ambient display.
Up until Android 7, it has been described as "Wake screen when device picked up or notifications arrive."

I like to see notifications, but I left Ambient display off, because I didn't want the other one, to wake the screen whenever I pick up the device.

In Android 7.1, the description has changed to "Wake screen when you receive notifications."
That's good, that they got rid of the one I don't like.

The bad news is that it now unconditionally wakes the screen when you pick up the device.
