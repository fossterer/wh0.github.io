Safari keeps track of the pages you have visited in each tab, so you can easily return to pages you were looking at before.
There are lots of ways to use to navigate through this history:

* **Click the "<" button** in the top left: go back one page.
* **Press Command-[** on the keyboard: go back one page.
* **Press Command-Left Arrow** on the keyboard: go back one page.
* **Swipe left with two fingers** on the trackpad: go back one page, freeze for a few seconds, and zoom out a little.
