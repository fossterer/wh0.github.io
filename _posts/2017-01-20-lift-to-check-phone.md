There's a switch to turn off "Lift to check phone" on Android.
It's in the "Moves" section of the settings.
I just found out about this.
I heard that it was added in a recent security update.
Thanks, security.

[The commit](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/1ad58d0abf63a2b1675a93f908367b8a2ed56a08) that adds this was made in September.
